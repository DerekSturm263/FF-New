  _description: "<b>Version 0.1.7a (04/20/2024)</b>\r\n\r\nAdded:\r\n  - An HUD for
    each player in the game. The HUD keeps track of their:\r\n    - Health\r\n   
    - Energy\r\n    - Stocks\r\n  - To be included in a future update is the correct
    portrait, username, and player number\r\n  - The energy system\r\n    - The player
    can not use their Burst if they don't have enough energy (20, will be adjusted)\r\n   
    - The player starts the match with 20 energy\r\n    - Energy will be used for
    Sub-Weapons and Ultimates in the future\r\n  - The health system\r\n    - The
    player will lose a stock once their health reaches 0\r\n  - The stock system\r\n   
    - In the future, once a player hits 0 stock (if the ruleset has that as a lose
    condition), then they will lose the match\r\n  - Support for multiple local players.
    This isn't finished yet, but just needs to be bugfixed\r\n\r\nUpdated:\r\n  -
    The copyright information to include the company name\r\n  - The credits to include
    the updated copyright information\r\n\r\nFixed:\r\n  - An issue where loading
    into new scenes would reset the button prompts back to the Keyboard\r\n  - An
    issue where the credits would seem to restart once it reached the end and the
    user continued scrolling\r\n  - The player index now begins at 0 instead of 1"
